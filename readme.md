Hello everyone. I decided to create and use this project in order to learn how to work with GitHub without affecting the main projects. 
When I was once again looking for a project that could be implemented, I came across the advice of a web developer who advised me to learn how to use github, 
design my projects beautifully, and others, and make a business card out of my profile, so without further ado, I decided to learn how to do this. 
For the main part of the project, I decided to take a guide from a YouTube channel in which a person suggests writing an admin panel for an online store. 
I really liked this idea, because this page can be cool to implement in your first working project. When I finish this project completely, 
I will upload the visual part to a new repository with open features so that every user can evaluate this work.
